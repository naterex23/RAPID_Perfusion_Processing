# RAPID_Perfusion_Processing

The purpose of this repository is to house the code associated with the processing of RAPID perfusion images associated with the ESCAPE-NA1 Database. 

All code should be executable with functions included in standard python libraries without modification.

A link to the publication will be added when appropriate. 

Note that this code takes generic RAPID output files (converted to a nifti format, files ending in ".nii" & ".nii.gz"), similar to below:

And converts each threshold to a segmentation that can be analyzed using a variety of medical imaging software. Notably, I used 3D Slicer (http://slicer.org).
